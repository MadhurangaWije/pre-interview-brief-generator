## Description

## Use case

When a candidate applies for a job, theyâ€™d like to learn more about the person who is interviewing them. We have a designated email address - pmb@aristotlehq.com email which you can send an email that will trigger the workflow. In the email body - they write in natural language - their LinkedIn profile, then the LinkedIn profile of the person they are meeting alongside the company they are interviewing for.

## Notes

- When building this system, please use NestJS for the backend, and use BullMQ message processor for taking in the request and running the scraping processors.
- For scraping - look at the below library implemented in Python that uses GPT3 to scrape. Use the method used by that to do it on node js.

- Please use xState https://github.com/statelyai/xstate to maintain a state machine on the backend for each request that comes in.
- Use Prisma for ORM and PostgreSQL for database.
- You are welcome to use ChatGPT / GitHub Co-pilot to deliver this project.
- Assume that the starting point of your application is a webhook calling with an email subject and body from a service like SendGrid.
- This is a tool/ service/ product used by candidates, and you are going to charge them $5 in the future. This tool is not how you apply for a job.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm run start

# Limitations
- Linkedin profile page cannot be scraped as Linkedin has taken several measures to block it.
